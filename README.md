# DAY-19
# 📘 Day 19 – SQL Injection (SQLi)
## 100 Days of Hacking – Study Notes

## 📌 Overview
On Day 19, I studied SQL Injection attacks and how improper input validation can expose entire databases.

This learning was conducted in a controlled, legal environment for educational purposes.

---

## 🔍 What is SQL Injection?
SQL Injection occurs when untrusted user input is directly included in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database logic.

---

## ⚠️ Why SQL Injection Is Dangerous
SQL Injection can allow:
- Unauthorized data access
- Authentication bypass
- Data modification or deletion
- Backend system compromise

---

## 🧠 Root Causes
- Trusting user input
- Dynamic query construction
- Missing parameterized queries
- Poor error handling

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Measures
- Use prepared statements / parameterized queries
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Apply least-privilege access to databases
- Handle errors securely
- Perform regular security testing

---

## 📌 Key Insight
One vulnerable input field can expose an entire database.
